## Overview

### Music Player Web Application

The Music Player Web Application is a responsive single-page application that utilizes the Spotify API to fetch data from a selection of artists and allows users to enjoy a bit of music within their web browser.

The app's design draws inspiration from the iconic aesthetic of the early 2000s, reminiscent of the days when music enthusiasts enjoyed their favorite tunes on compact disc CDs, often accompanied by a trusty "Discman" or CD player. The goal is to evoke a sense of nostalgia and deliver a relaxed music-listening experience that resonates with users.
